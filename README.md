# CourseDB

The queries constructed by me for the final week of the Intro to SQL class on Coursera to create a Many to Many relational database of users and courses.

For future project work, I could add some of the following: more courses, users, and professors, add associate professors (role within the Member table), credit hours per course, cost per course, completed vs enrolled vs dropped progress
